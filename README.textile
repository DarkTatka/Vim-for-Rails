h1. The awesome Vim config files

This will allow you to run mac vim and develop on Ruby on Rails.

Some features include:
* nice theme for gui and terminal with 16 colors. (ir_black and xterm16)
* incremental Search that ignore case by default
* Swap and backup out of your way

to install:
you need to install macvim with ruby support

sudo port install macvim +ruby

git clone git://github.com/framallo/Vim-for-Rails.git ~/.vim

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

user settings can go in ~/.vimrc.local

,f = fuzzy find all files                                               
,F = Fuzzy find flush (refresh when new files are created)
,b = fuzzy find in all buffers                                          
,p = go to previous file                                                
,t = toogle taglist

,h = new horizontal window                                              
,v = new vertical window                                                
                                                                        
,i = toggle invisibles

:call Tabstyle_tabs = set tab to real tabs                              
:call Tabstyle_spaces = set tab to 2 spaces                             

h1. Keyboard Layout

I use english keyboard layout since is the most efficient layout for development.
Also I use the Caps Lock key as control key. 


h1. Wish List

Things i want to include, build, improve, etc

* Git grep inside vim 
* mvim should open a new tab and pwd should be set to the current file
* running 'mvim' or 'mvim .' should open the NERDTREE by default and an empty window on the right
