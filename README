The awesome Vim config files
============================

This will allow you to run mac vim and develop on Ruby on Rails.

Some features include:
* nice theme for gui and terminal with 16 colors. (ir_black and xterm16)
* incremental Search that ignore case by default
* Swap and backup out of your way

to install:

git clone git://github.com/framallo/Vim-for-Rails.git ~/.vim

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

user settings can go in ~/.vimrc.local 


USAGE
=====

jj = <esc>  Very useful for keeping your hands on the home row          
,n = toggle NERDTree off and on                                         
,f = fuzzy find all files                                               
,F = Fuzzy find flush (refresh when new files are created)
,b = fuzzy find in all buffers                                          
,p = go to previous file                                                
,t = toogle taglist                                                     
                                                                        
hh = inserts '=>'                                                       
aa = inserts '@'                                                        
                                                                        
,h = new horizontal window                                              
,v = new vertical window                                                
                                                                        
,i = toggle invisibles                                                  
                                                                        
enter and shift-enter = adds a new line after/before the current line   
                                                                        
:call Tabstyle_tabs = set tab to real tabs                              
:call Tabstyle_spaces = set tab to 2 spaces                             

Keyboard Layout
===============

I use english keyboard layout since is the most efficient layout for development.
Also I use the Caps Lock key as control key. 


Wish List
=========
Things i want to include, build, improve, etc

* Git grep inside vim 
* mvim should open a new tab and pwd should be set to the current file
* running 'mvim' or 'mvim .' should open the NERDTREE by default and an empty window on the right

Thanks
